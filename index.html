      <p>Hey friend,</p>
      <p>Woah, you actually came! You rock, thanks a lot.</p>
      <p>I wish I had a wicked siq demo that you could play with, but it turns out that there's not much to show at the start of a project. Who knew? I made a few drawings to show you what the game <em>might</em> be like one day, but then I changed my mind on everything and had to start over.</p>
      <p>Love,<br>Nick</p>

        <cite>Part One</cite> is a gorey, genre-bending action adventure where you and your bros can unlock killer rewards to slay the competition. Pick one of three amazing classes and exolore our revolutionary craft system to make your weapons even bigger and badder. Create a unique avatar from one of our 16 prototypes (don't worry, they're all beefy white dudes, just like you). All you need to play is an account on the Octahedral Platform, where you can access exclusive games and content. Collect cool badges by referring and recruiting your bros to the tribe. Game on.

        This game sounds awful, right? Well, that's where all the money is in games right now. The games with the biggest budgets are the ones that game publishers know will sell, which are games like these. The same kind of people make the same kind of games that are played by the same kind of audiences who become the next generation of game makers, and so on. Let's get some fresh ideas! What if we had empowering games that explore motherhood, made by mothers. Horror games that allow you to interact with power structures built on race. Or <cite>Part One</cite>! A game about many things, but currently: origin, perspective, fate, and love!
